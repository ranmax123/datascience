# Data science code
Here you will find my codes written to solve data science problems.

The codes will be related to deep learning algorithms like RNN, DNN, CNN, and to machine learning algorithms like Regression, Classification.

NLP
  * **Tweet Racism Prediction** - Created a LSTM Recurrent Neural Network model in Keras and Tensorflow to predict whether a tweet is racist or not.
  * **Emojify** - Created a LSTM RNN to solve classification problem and predicted emoji from input text
  
Regression
  * Find out the next set of score for DOTA game
  
Timeseries
  * Created a deep learning model to predict users enrollment in next 7 months
